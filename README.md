Megaventory Project using megaventory APIS to perform certain tasks .

In this Project I used a Model - Main - API architecture . 
Models package includes all entities 
Main package is where the main function is that runs .
API package includes the classes that edit the DB and perform all changes / send requests 

The project is written in JAVA . 

The code is pretty basic . I create instances of objects from Models package and then use API instances to perform the requests . 
The code is not fully functional . Responses are 200 which is good but either the api URL or the Json string is not exactly fit to whats needed to actually work but thats 
a small issue . The general logic is there and very easy to read and add onto . This project was similar to a project of mine related to a Database which was mostly backend 
https://github.com/stexas341/Files-and-Databases  . This is the repo we worked on as a team with 2 other people thats why its not on my github just yet . On that project we
added/deleted vehicles to a database , updated availability , damages and that kind of stuff .
